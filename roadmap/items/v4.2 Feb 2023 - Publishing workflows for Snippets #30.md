# Publishing workflows for Snippets

## Summary

As part of the work detailed in [Supercharging Snippets](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8609), we would like to introduce the publishing workflows feature into Snippets.

## Intended Outcome

In addition to pages, workflows can also be assigned to snippet models that have been configured to support them (e.g. through a `WorkflowMixin`).

## How will it work?

If a snippet model has a workflow assigned, a "submit to workflow" action menu item will show up when editing its instances.

<img alt="snippet edit view, with 'submit to moderators approval' action menu item" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6379424/204589500-d2b6b344-7279-4d55-905e-4591b70bcdb4.png" width="420" />

Once a snippet is submitted to a workflow, it will go through the whole workflow process in the same way as pages, and will be published at the end of the workflow.
