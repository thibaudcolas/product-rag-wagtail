# Revamped Editor Guide

## Summary

Following from [Hitansh Shah’s Editor Guide website project](https://wagtail.org/blog/google-summer-of-code-wagtail-editor-guide/), we now want to improve and expand the contents of our Editor Guide website.

## Intended Outcome

The Editor Guide documentation will cover all major functionality of the latest release of Wagtail, with different types of content. It will be available in multiple languages.

## How will it work?

The documentation will be available on https://guide.wagtail.org/, linked to from the CMS.

## More information

- See https://github.com/wagtail/guide/discussions/116.
