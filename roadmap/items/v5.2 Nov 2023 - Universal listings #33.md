# Universal listings

## Summary

Exploring design solutions for making sites / sections with 1000s of pages and little to no tree structure easier to navigate in the CMS.

The aim is to enhance the searching / filtering capabilities of the main page listing view (and to eventually roll out the same patterns and functionality to all listings within the CMS).

## Intended Outcome

Websites / sections of websites with thousands of pages and little to no structure are easier to navigate in the CMS. Other websites are also easier to manage.
