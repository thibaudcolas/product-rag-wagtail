# Orderable snippets

Support to rearrange the order of snippets in the admin interface, similar to pages’ "Sort menu order".

## Intended outcome

Feature parity between pages and other models, for added flexibility and to ease adoption of Wagtail for existing Django projects.

## More information

See [Rearrange order of Snippets in ModelViewSet index view #10816](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10816) & [Add reordering support to generic IndexView #13323](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/13323).
