# Headless improvements roadmap

## Summary

Completion of planning tasks so Wagtail has a clear roadmap for improvements to its existing headless website capabilities, with a particular focus on improvements made to Wagtail core.

## Intended Outcome

- RFC 100 review: approved or rejected.
- Creation of the 5-10 tracking issues needed to implement the RFC.
  - For example feature requests for a headless userbar, headless accessibility checks.
- Completion of [moving headless docs to the developer documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/12039)
- TBC: creation of a headless bakerydemo.
