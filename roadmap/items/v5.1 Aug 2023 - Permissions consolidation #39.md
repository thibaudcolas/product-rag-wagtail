# Permissions consolidation

## Summary

Consolidating our approach to permissions so code is easier to maintain.

## Intended Outcome

- Consistent permission model
- Single approach for permissions (tech debt/performance as we can then introduce better caching in one place)
- Page choose permission
- Cache permissions to reduce queries

## More information

- RFC or GitHub Discussions will be created closer to the release planning.
