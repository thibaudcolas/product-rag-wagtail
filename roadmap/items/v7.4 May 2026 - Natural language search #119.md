# Natural language search

**Tentative item, highly dependent on evolution of vector indexing / search capabilities across database backends**. Improvement to Wagtail’s search interface to support natural language queries.

## Intended outcome

Depending on underlying search backend capabilities, this would either be:

- Vector search, with semantic understanding of queries and content.
- Or RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approach, combining traditional search with LLMs to interpret queries and content.
- Or (TBC) conversational search interface, with follow-up questions and clarifications.
