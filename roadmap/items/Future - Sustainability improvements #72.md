# Sustainability improvements

Improvements across three key areas for Wagtail sites’ carbon footprints: measurements, awareness, tangible reductions. To see widespread improvements across Wagtail’s ecosystem, for example in [how Wagtail sites score on digital carbon ratings](https://wagtail.org/blog/digital-carbon-ratings-in-practice/):
