# llms.txt for docs

Adoption of the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) proposal for the Wagtail developer documentation and user guide, to help Wagtail users more easily find information via AI tools.

## Intended outcome

Versioned llms.txt variants for docs.wagtail.org and guide.wagtail.org, refined to support different context windows. Tested with common queries for quality / suitability, so those files can be maintained long-term.
