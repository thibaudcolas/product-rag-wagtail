# Headless preview

Moving preview support for headless sites from a separate package to a built-in feature.

## Intended outcome

The [wagtail-headless-preview](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-headless-preview) package is no longer needed, and instead site implementers are able to use equivalent functionality from the core implementation.

## More information

See:

- [bakerydemo-nextjs](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo-nextjs)
- [RFC 100: Enhancing headless support](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/100).
