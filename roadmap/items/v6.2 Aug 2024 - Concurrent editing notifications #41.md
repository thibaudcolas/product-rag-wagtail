# Concurrent editing notifications

A stepping stone to [Autosave (roadmap#24)](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/24).

## Intended Outcome

To prevent CMS users from accidentally overwriting each other’s content, we will implement concurrent viewing and editing notifications in CMS editing forms. The first user to visit the page editor will not notice any difference and be able to edit normally. If other users view the same form concurrently, all users will be aware of one-another’s presence. The UI will inform users of any ongoing edits or new revisions being saved, so users can decide for themselves whether to abandon their changes or override each others’ work.
