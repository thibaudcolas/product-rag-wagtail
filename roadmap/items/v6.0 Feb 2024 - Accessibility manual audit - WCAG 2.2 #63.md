# Accessibility manual audit - WCAG 2.2

## Summary

Follow-up to [Admin accessibility audit #46](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/46). In the last release, we focused on auditing all aspects of ATAG aside from Guideline _A.1.1: Ensure that web-based functionality is accessible_, which is a matter of WCAG conformance. We did automated testing of the Wagtail admin, and now have manual tests to go through.

## Intended outcome

Complete an accessibility audit as per discussions in [WCAG 2.2 AAA* audit of the Wagtail admin](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11180).
