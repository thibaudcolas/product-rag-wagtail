# Sustainability roadmap

## Summary

As a follow-up to [Sustainability considerations for Wagtail sites #38](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/38), a review of possible improvements to Wagtail that we could integrate on our roadmap in the future. In particular with the view to learn from [Web Sustainability Guidelines 1.0](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/).

## Intended outcome

- Extensive review of the [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/), with a particular focus on applicability for the Wagtail CMS and Wagtail websites.
- Refinement of a potential program of sustainability improvements to Wagtail, with the view to reduce its [carbon footprint](http://wagtail.org/sustainability/).
