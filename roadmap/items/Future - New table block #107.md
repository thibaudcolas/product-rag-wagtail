# New table block

Creation of a new table editing UI in the CMS, addressing the shortcomings of the existing [TableBlock based on Handsontable 6.2.2](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/table_block.html), and [TypedTableBlock](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/typed_table_block.html) based on StreamField.

## Intended outcome

- Support for rich text content in cells
- Accessible table editing interface
- Migration path from the existing TableBlock
