# Customizable page explorer

Support for customizations such as additional columns (and filters), reducing the need for developers to create custom views for pages.

## Intended outcome

- Simplify common customizations that help for larger sites
- Lower cost of ownership / upgrade considerations for customizations to page listings

## More information

See [Support custom columns / filters on main page explorer #11931](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/11931).
