# Headless demo site

An official demo site focused on demonstrating [Wagtail’s headless support](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/headless.html) – primarily so our contributors and maintainers can more easily work on headless improvements.

## Intended outcome

The primary goal is to be able to demo / test the headless capabilities of Wagtail in a representative site. Demonstrating best practices would be good, where it makes sense.

For long-term maintenance, we aim to keep ongoing efforts as low as possible: no hosted environment, make changes in the [existing bakerydemo](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo) as much as possible (for example server-side API configuration), limit adoption of patterns that are very framework-specific where possible.

Here is the provisional choices made with the vue to repurpose the [bakerydemo-nextjs](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/bakerydemo-nextjs) as this new demo site:

- Keep Next.js, as it’s the most popular option per our survey. Use server-rendered Next.js as it will be a better test of headless Wagtail capabilities.
- Keep TypeScript. Keep using the existing bakerydemo’s styles and template markup wherever possible
- Switch from GraphQL to the built-in Wagtail REST API (more popular and it’s better to demo core features).

Features which are (currently) out of scope:

- Multi-site
- GraphQL
