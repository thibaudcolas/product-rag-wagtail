# Workflow enhancements

UX enhancements to the [moderation workflows](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/how-to-guides/configure-workflows-for-moderation/) feature, including better integration with commenting. Collage of different concept mockups:

## Intended outcome

We have yet to confirm specific changes. Pending user feedback or a specific [feature sponsorship](https://wagtail.org/sponsor/), here are the enhancements we have in mind:

- Dashboard workflow panel improvements
  - ([Workflow approval UI on dashboard is confusing #7132](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/7132))
- Modernisation of the workflow UI
- Potentially introduction of more automation
- More granular options when sending content "back" to previous steps in a workflow: send back to any previous step?
- Better integration with comments, allowing granular comments in workflows
