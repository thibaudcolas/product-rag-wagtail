# Search backend rewrite

Refactoring of Wagtail's search backends API to reduce technical debt and better support future improvements, such as vector indexing as a search backend, or better support for hybrid search concepts.

## Intended outcome

- Simper long-term maintenance of existing search backends, including understand which backends support which features
- Integration with vector indexing / vector search capabilities
- Path towards supporting natural language search

## More information
