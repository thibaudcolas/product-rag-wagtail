# Site settings permissions

A new permission model for sites, where groups can be assigned permissions at the level of individual sites. This better maps organisational structures, compared to the current model of permissions being assigned at the level of the settings model rather than instances.

## Intended outcome

Better multi-site support, with separate groups being able to manage their own site’s settings.

## More information

For more information, see [RFC 105: Site settings permissions](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/105).
