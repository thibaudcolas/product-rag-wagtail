# Image library UX improvements

Improvements to the design and user experience of image management in Wagtail, complementing the existing "Media listings UX" GSoC Project. Mockup of the list layout for images:

<img width="1080" height="800" alt="Images listing with header and images list" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1530f022-dcdd-4b04-a907-430b6a6c7136" />
