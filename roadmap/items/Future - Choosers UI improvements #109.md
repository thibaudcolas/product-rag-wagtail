# Choosers UI improvements

Iterative improvements towards a new design for choosers, which brings them closer to the "Universal listings" UX rolled out across listing views.

## Intended outcome

- Sorting and filtering capabilities
- Improved accessibility
- A clearer path towards common link chooser requests: unification with document chooser, custom link types, custom fields

## More information
