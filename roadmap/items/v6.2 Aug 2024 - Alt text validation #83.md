# Alt text validation

A new feature to validate alt text on images, checking for the presence of problem patterns.

#### Intended Outcome

Improve the quality of alt text for existing content – while the [Alt text capabilities](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#alt-text-capabilities) project is more about new content.

#### More information

See [Alt text validation rule in the accessibility checker #11967](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/11967).
