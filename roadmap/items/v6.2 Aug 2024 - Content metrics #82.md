# Content metrics

New “Word count” and “Reading time” metrics. Those new built-in metrics will be useful for a lot of editors, and pave the way towards more advanced and bespoke metrics in the future (reading age, SEO keyword density, SEO quality traffic lights, etc).

#### Intended outcome

The metrics will be:

- Placed within the “Checks” panel
- Calculated based on the contents of the page as rendered in the live preview – currently for pages with the Wagtail userbar only.
- Calculated the same way for all languages.
