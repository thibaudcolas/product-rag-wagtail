# Flexible forms

Revamp of Wagtail’s forms creation, to create more flexible forms with StreamField.

## Intended outcome

More flexibility by using a StreamField-based form builder, with support for multi-step forms, and more common customizations. This may be in the form of a new "contrib" app, a replacement of the existing forms contrib app, or a standalone package.
