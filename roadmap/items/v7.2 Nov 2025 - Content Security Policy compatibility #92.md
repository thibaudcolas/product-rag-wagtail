# Content Security Policy compatibility

Wagtail is close to being compatible with strict [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP). With one final push, we can get fundamental features all compatible with CSPs, document support, and treat any gaps as bugs.

## Intended outcome

- Providing official recommendations for compatible CSP settings.
- Ensuring essential functionality works with a strict CSP.
- Documenting or backlogging all CSP-related issues.
