# Readability checks

Readability is fundamental to accessibility, and there are a lot of existing checks we could integrate directly in the CMS. Mockup, with a "reading age" metric and a "sentence is hard to read" content check:

## Intended outcome

- Content writers get relevant feedback on their content in real-time
- Readability metrics are built into the CMS and available across a wide range of languages
- Nice to have: Site-wide reporting

## More information

- [Content quality checkers #11063](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063)
- Example: [wagtail-readinglevel](https://pypi.org/project/wagtail-readinglevel/) as a score displayed in rich text fields.
