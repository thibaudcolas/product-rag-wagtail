# Draftail for general text entry

Switch to a rich text style UI for plain text inputs, to support more advanced text interactions. Mockup with one comment and one spellcheck annotation:

## Intended outcome

Support all content editing features limited to rich text, within all plain-text fields:

- Annotations like spellcheck or comments on specific words or sentences
- Analysis like reading level, word count
- Content generation tools like [Wagtail AI](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-ai)
