# Autosave MVP

**Save draft without page reload, on demand** – an incremental steps towards [autosave functionality](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/24). Mockup of future auto-save UI:

## Intended outcome

- Productivity boost for CMS users
- Incremental step towards collaborative editing (see [Our roadmap for collaborative content management](https://wagtail.org/blog/our-roadmap-for-collaborative-content-management/))

Once this is in place, combined with concurrent editing notifications, it will be possible for multiple editors to watch each others’ successive edits.
