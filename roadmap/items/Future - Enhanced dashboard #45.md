# Enhanced dashboard

Redesign of Wagtail’s dashboard to make it more useful as a starting point for both occasional and repeat CMS users. Mockup:

<img width="1512" height="1444" alt="dashboard enhanced concept with content quality, create pages, custom panels" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef3ba900-e37c-4395-9aa7-44d2fcee6951" />

## Intended outcome

- "Create content" entry point for users who want to dive straight into new content without having to understand the site structure.
- Integration with reporting tools
- Workflow functionality improvements
- Visual design changes to summary items and welcome message
- Options to support custom dashboard panels tailored to the user’s needs ("Frequent actions", "bookmarks", "Owned pages")
