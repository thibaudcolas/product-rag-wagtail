# Universal listings continued

Follow-up to [Universal listings improvements #62](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/62) and [Universal listings #33](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/33). Universal listings search and filter MVP features have been implemented for pages and snippets. There are more features to add, and the new listings need to be rolled out in other areas of the CMS.

See [Universal listings (search and filtering) #10446](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/10446#discussioncomment-7302866) in GitHub Discussions for the latest update on progress.
