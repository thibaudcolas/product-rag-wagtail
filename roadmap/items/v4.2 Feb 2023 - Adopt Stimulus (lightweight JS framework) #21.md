# Adopt Stimulus (lightweight JS framework)

## Summary

We are adopting Stimulus as the lightweight JavaScript framework in Wagtail to replace the need for jQuery, inline scripts and excessive global usage for per-component usage data.

## Intended Outcome

Parts of Wagtail’s existing jQuery code and inline scripts have been replaced with Stimulus controllers, and we have a clear direction on how to do lightweight interactivity in the future.

## How will it work?

Stimulus will be integrated into Wagtail and leveraged by existing core components. Documentation will be available for core contributors, as well as APIs for third-party customisations.

## More information

- See [RFC 78: Adopt Stimulus (lightweight JS framework) 🎛️](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/78)
