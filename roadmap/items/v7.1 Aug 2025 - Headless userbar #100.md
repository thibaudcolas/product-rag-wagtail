# Headless userbar

Adding built-in support for the Wagtail userbar in headless mode, including accessibility checks, based on built-in preview support.

## Intended outcome

Bring all existing userbar features to all headless websites:

- Live preview scroll restoration
- Accessibility checks
- Content metrics (word count, reading time)

## More information

For more information, see [RFC 100: Enhancing headless support](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/100).
