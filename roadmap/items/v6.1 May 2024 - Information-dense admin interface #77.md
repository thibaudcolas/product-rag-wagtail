# Information-dense admin interface

Refinements to the CMS admin interface to improve information density. See [Information density: spacious/snug mode #11265](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/11265).

## Intended outcome

- Admin interface UI tweaks for all users to improve information density.
- A possible opt-in "theme" option for users who want even greater information density.
