# Autosave

Making it faster to edit pages and other models in Wagtail, opening the way to concurrent editing. See [Our roadmap for collaborative content management](https://wagtail.org/blog/our-roadmap-for-collaborative-content-management/). Mockup of auto-saving while the user works on their edits:

## Intended Outcome

3. [x] #93 
2. [ ] #47: Save draft without page reload, on demand
3. [ ] Save draft automatically
4. [ ] Individual field locking
