# Media versioning

Enhancing Wagtail’s images and documents to support better auditing / history tracking, similarly to pages. Mockup:

<img width="952" height="616" alt="mockup of media versioning with images listing with history of image versions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feba32f1-2364-4c64-8174-a341024aafb2" />

## Intended outcome

- View past versions of images and documents
- Versioning metadata: when and by whom were changes made
- Revert to a past version
- Compare versions
- TBC: drafts and published versions
