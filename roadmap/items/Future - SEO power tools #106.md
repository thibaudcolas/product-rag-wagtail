# SEO power tools

See [Looking for sponsorship: SEO power tools](https://wagtail.org/blog/looking-for-sponsorship-seo-power-tools/). New built-in SEO and content quality assurance features, with opportunities for integration with SEO and analytics tools, as well as generative AI. Screenshot of some of those features as mocked up:

## Intended outcome

Examples:

- Manual quality assurance tools (metadata preview in the page editor and site-wide reporting)
- Automated quality checks ([SEO search description automated content check #12252](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/12252))
- Generative content (for example link / related pages suggestions)
- Reporting ([Custom content metrics support in page editor #12935](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/12935))
