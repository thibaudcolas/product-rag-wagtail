# Validation on publish

## Summary

Implementation of a frequently-requested feature: save draft versions of pages in an incomplete state, while still enforcing validation when publishing. This is a pre-requisite to implementing auto-save as proposed in [RFC 99: Preliminary work to support auto-save functionality](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/99).

## Intended Outcome

Incremental progress towards auto-save functionality in Wagtail.

## More information

See [RFC 104: Validation on publish](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/104).
