# Block settings

A new capability for StreamField blocks, to group "settings" or rarely-used fields in a separate section to reduce clutter in the editor. Mockup:

![animated block settings sub-block within blocks list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/556ca413-75d6-44bc-b912-40491e9342b2)

## Intended outcome

- Reduced clutter for CMS users when block settings are in place
- Simple API for developers to decide which block fields can be hidden away

## More information
