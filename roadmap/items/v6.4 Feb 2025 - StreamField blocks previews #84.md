# StreamField blocks previews

## Summary

Block descriptions and previews will support content editors in making more informed choices when selecting blocks, speeding up the creation of new content.

## Intended Outcome

- Developers will be able to add StreamField block descriptions, similar to [page_description](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/pages.html#id1), but for block types.
- They will also be able to add StreamField block preview screenshots.
- When added, this information will appear within the block chooser UI for CMS users.

## More information

See: [StreamField block type descriptions and image previews in block chooser #11997](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/11997).
