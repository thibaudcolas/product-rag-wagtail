# Enhanced contrast admin themes

We will introduce a set of a new way to theme the Wagtail admin interface, specifically for low-vision users who would benefit for higher color contrast and clearer visual cues of interactive elements. This is a follow-up to the introduction of [Dark Mode #65](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/65) and [information density theming](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/77). This builds upon the work to make the admin theme-able and to adapt it based on user needs (see also [contrast themes support](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/2). This aligns well with Wagtail’s goals to improve accessibility.

#### Intended outcome

- The opt-in theming option will be available for all users via a theme switcher in their account profile form.
- The main focus for now is a "more contrast" theming option, but we might also offer "less contrast" in the future.
