# Maintainer week

Over a week at the end of October, we will go through our pull request and issues backlogs and triage. This will take the form of an online event across multiple days, and other activities to be determined tied with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

## Intended outcome

For pull requests, this means reviewing a subset and:

- Assess their current state, post a comment on that state
- Merge the ones that can be merged.
- Close the ones that should be transferred into a new issue (or an update posted on its existing related issue).

PRs that are not closed or merged will be targeted for resolution in future release cycles.

For issues, we can similarly triage some of the:

- [Unconfirmed bug reports](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?page=1&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astatus%3AUnconfirmed) (current: 86)
- [“Needs design decision” issues](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22status%3ANeeds+Design+Decision%22) (current: 42)
- Possibly other issues based on criteria to be determined.
