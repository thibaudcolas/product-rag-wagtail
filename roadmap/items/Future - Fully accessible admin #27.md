# Fully accessible admin

Work towards making [Wagtail’s accessibility](https://wagtail.org/accessibility/) world-class – stellar feedback from users of assistive technologies on the admin interface. Full compliance with relevant standards: WCAG, ATAG. View our [latest Accessibility Conformance Report](https://wagtail.org/accessibility/acr/). Current progress (Wagtail 7.0 LTS):

| Conformance Level  | Web | Electronic Documents | Software | Authoring Tool |
| ------------------ | --- | -------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Supports           | 70  | 63                   | 0        | 49             |
| Partially Supports | 3   | 0                    | 0        | 12             |
| Does Not Support   | 0   | 9                    | 0        | 12             |
| Not Applicable     | 13  | 14                   | 86       | 13             |

- 100% ATAG 2.0 Part A AA conformance
