# Google Summer of Code 2024

Wagtail takes part in the Google Summer of Code programme in 2024, with two projects:

- [Alt text capabilities](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#alt-text-capabilities).
- [Low-carbon accessible project templates](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#alt-text-capabilities).

#### Intended Outcome

We work with beginners to open source as part of the internships.
