## Intended outcome

Features considered to date:

- **Content summaries**: for example page descriptions, or even titles.
- **Image descriptions**: captions, alt text, ideally contextual (adjusted for surrounding content).
- **Content classification**: auto-filling categories or tags.
- **Related content suggestions**: encouraging linking to existing pages where suitable.
- **Translations**: making it simpler to create multilingual sites or even one-off pages.
- **Qualitative content feedback**: think readability improvements or style guide alignment.
- **Quantitative feedback**: repeatable metrics based on the page’s content.
- **Improvements suggestions**: based on automated accessibility and SEO checks.
- **PDF to HTML conversion**: a common requirement to make content more accessible.
