# CSP compatibility audit

## Summary

An up-to-date review of [CSP compatibility issues](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/1288) in Wagtail, with the view to help resolve them all in future releases.

## Intended outcome

This will replace the [last feature-by-feature review](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/7053) which was 4 years ago. We need a clearer record as we now have CSP [on our roadmap](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/92) and [as a GSoC project idea](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#content-security-policy-compatibility). Aside from auditing, this will involve adding findings in Wagtail issues, or logged to a "CSP compatibility" board in GitHub Projects.

And if there is time, here are stretch tasks on our way to the [CSP roadmap item](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/92):

- [Updating the bakerydemo CSP](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo/blob/main/.env.example) to be on by default, and document stricter options that are compatible, if possible.
- Updating the developer docs to document current level of CSP support
- Updating guide.wagtail.org or wagtail.org with a CSP
