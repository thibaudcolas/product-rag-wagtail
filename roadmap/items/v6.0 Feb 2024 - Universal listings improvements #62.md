# Universal listings improvements

## Summary

Follow-up to [Universal listings #33](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/33). A lot of progress has been made, particularly on the designs, and there is more to do to complete the implementation.

See [Universal listings (search and filtering) #10446](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/10446#discussioncomment-7302866) in GitHub Discussions for the latest update on progress, and [static-wagtail-v5-2](https://static-wagtail-v5-2.netlify.app/admin/pages/60/) for a static demo.

## Intended Outcome

Websites / sections of websites with thousands of pages and little to no structure are easier to navigate in the CMS. Other websites are also easier to manage.
