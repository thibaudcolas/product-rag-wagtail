# Single-line rich text fields

Creation of a new field type: single-line rich text fields. See [standalone demo](https://demo.draftail.org/storybook/?path=/story/docs--single-line). Mockup:

<img width="650" height="234" alt="Mockup of a single-line rich text field with bold italic line break link comments" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9fafb6c-3a29-42be-b2a5-1e2fe7ccea81" />

## Intended Outcome

- Rich text features can be used for single-line text.
- Commenting support for specific words within single-line text.

## How will it work?

There will be a new field type working similarly to existing rich text support, but constrained to a single line.
